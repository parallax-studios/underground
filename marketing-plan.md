# UNDERGROUND — Marketing Plan

**Marketing Lead**: HYPE
**Status**: Complete — Ready for Execution
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-02-07

---

## 0. THE MARKETING THESIS

**UNDERGROUND is the game the 2000s never finished making, and the audience has been waiting for it ever since.**

This is not a nostalgia cash-grab. This is unfinished business. Need for Speed Underground stopped at racing. Def Jam stopped at fighting. FIFA Street stopped at balling. Tony Hawk stopped at tricks. No one ever unified them. No one ever said "what if ALL of street culture was one game, one identity, one legend?" Until now.

The marketing pitch is simple: **We are making the PS2 game that should have existed, with the AI and systems design of 2026.** This is a game that looks like your memory of 2003, not the reality of 2003. CRT scan lines. Underglow kits. Baggy jeans. Hip-hop on the soundtrack. All of it rendered with modern precision but vintage soul.

The audience is split in two:
1. **25-38 year olds** who LIVED this era and have been typing "NFS Underground 3 when?" into forums for 20 years.
2. **18-25 year olds** who discovered 2000s culture through TikTok, retro streams, and Y2K fashion coming back.

Both audiences want the same thing: to feel what it was like when street culture was the coolest thing in the world. We give them that feeling. We give them the hook, the loop, the REP grind, the rivalry system, the Style Meter that lets you chain a drift into a dunk into a knockout.

This marketing plan is built around one goal: **100,000 Steam wishlists by announcement + 6 months.** That is the threshold where algorithmic visibility kicks in, where streamers pay attention, where press takes you seriously. Everything we do ladders up to that number.

Start building the audience NOW. Not six months before launch. NOW.

## 1. THE HOOK (Three Versions)

Every piece of marketing collateral needs a hook. Here are three versions, calibrated for different contexts.

### 1.1 The One-Sentence Hook (Twitter/X, Elevator Pitch, Steam Capsule Text)

**"Race, fight, ball, and style your way from nobody to legend in the 2003 street culture game that never existed."**

38 words. Discipline clarity (four verbs). Era anchor (2003). Aspiration (nobody to legend). Intrigue ("never existed" implies something was missing, and we are fixing it).

### 1.2 The One-Paragraph Hook (Steam Short Description, Press Email Subject Line, Reddit Post Opener)

**"UNDERGROUND is Need for Speed Underground meets Def Jam meets FIFA Street meets Tony Hawk — four genres, one city, one reputation system, zero loading between who you are. It's 2003. You're nobody. Build your name through racing, fighting, street sports, and freestyle tricks in a city that remembers everything you do. A PS2-era fever dream rendered with modern AI rival systems, cross-discipline style chaining, and a story about what happens when the underground goes viral."**

98 words. Comps up front (instant genre clarity). Hook restated (four genres, one identity). Emotional framing (you're nobody, build your name). Modern twist reveal (AI rivals, style chaining, viral story). Era aesthetic locked in (PS2 fever dream).

### 1.3 The One-Page Hook (Press Kit Intro, Investor Deck, Crowdfunding Campaign Opener)

**It's 2003 and you just rolled into the city with nothing but a rattling hatchback and a hunger to be somebody. The Underground is real — street races in industrial corridors, cage fights at the docks, legendary pickup games at The Cage in Midtown, trick sessions in the Heights where the city itself is a skatepark. Four disciplines. One reputation system. One Style Meter that turns your best moment in a drift into momentum for your next crossover, your next combo, your next knockout.**

**UNDERGROUND is the game the 2000s wanted to make but couldn't — a unified street culture career where racing, fighting, street sports, and freestyle tricks are all expressions of the same legend. You're not playing four minigames. You're building one identity across four languages, and the city tracks everything. Win with style and your REP explodes. Humiliate a rival and they remember — they adapt, they escalate, they come back harder or join your crew. This is the Nemesis System meets car culture meets streetball meets 2003 aesthetic rendered in neon and chrome.**

**Visually, we are making the PS2 game that never shipped — CRT scan lines, underglow kits bleeding cyan and magenta onto wet asphalt, chunky beveled UI, low-poly models with high-res textures, a color palette ripped from Fast and the Furious and Def Jam's best lighting. But under the hood, it's modern: AI-driven rival personalities with grudges and respect meters, cross-discipline synergies that reward mastery across all four styles, a story about authenticity versus fame that asks what happens when a viral video exposes the underground to the mainstream.**

**Comp it like this:**
- **"Need for Speed Underground meets Yakuza"** — Racing and customization in a living open world where rivals remember.
- **"Def Jam: Fight for NY meets Football Manager"** — Brutal fighting with deep AI relationship systems.
- **"FIFA Street meets Balatro"** — Streetball energy with a build/synergy metagame.
- **"Tony Hawk's Underground meets the Nemesis System"** — Trick mastery where every rival evolves.**

**The target: Players aged 25-38 who grew up on this era and players aged 18-25 who discovered it through TikTok and retro streams. The former want the game they never got. The latter want the aesthetic they just found. Both get a loop so tight, a rival system so alive, and a style ceiling so high that the game has legs at hour 50 and beyond.**

**Platform: PC (Steam primary), Console (PS5/Xbox secondary). Launch target: Q4 2027. Pre-launch beats: Announce trailer (viral hook), Steam Next Fest demo (single district vertical slice), closed beta (rival AI stress test), launch.**

**This is UNDERGROUND. One city. Four disciplines. One reputation. Build your legend.**

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCE PROFILE

Marketing works when you know EXACTLY who you're talking to. Here's the breakdown.

### 2.1 Primary Audience: "The OGs" (25-38 years old)

**Who they are:**
- Grew up on PS2/Xbox/GameCube era (2000-2006).
- Played Need for Speed Underground 1&2, Def Jam: Fight for NY, FIFA Street, Tony Hawk's Underground, Midnight Club 3.
- Typed "why doesn't anyone make games like this anymore?" at least once in the last five years.
- Active on gaming Reddit (r/patientgamers, r/gaming, r/retrogaming), Twitter/X gaming communities, YouTube (watch retrospectives and "games that aged like wine" videos).
- Own a gaming PC or current-gen console. Disposable income. Will pay full price ($40-50) for a game that scratches this itch.

**What they want:**
- The feeling they had when they first played Underground 2's career mode or Def Jam's story mode.
- Depth. They are older now. They want the nostalgia aesthetic but they also want systems that respect their time and intelligence.
- A game that doesn't apologize for its influences. They are tired of "retro-inspired" games that feel like shallow pastiches. They want reverence, not parody.

**How we reach them:**
- Targeted Reddit posts in r/needforspeed, r/ps2, r/FinalFantasyMemes (side: many OGs love deep systems), r/Yakuza (Yakuza fans GET the "dense city, lots of minigames, deep relationships" vibe).
- YouTube influencers who cover "games you forgot existed" and "the golden age of arcade racers" (e.g., Whitelight, NakeyJakey, Matthewmatosis, Raycevick).
- Twitter/X hashtags: #PS2Games, #NeedForSpeedUnderground, #DefJam, #RetroGaming, #IndieGames.
- Steam tags: Street Racing, Automobile Sim, Fighting, Sports, Character Action Game, Replay Value, Great Soundtrack.

**The pitch to them:**
"This is the game you remember existing, but it never did. We made it."

---

### 2.2 Secondary Audience: "The Rediscoverers" (18-25 years old)

**Who they are:**
- Discovered 2000s culture through TikTok (Y2K fashion trends, "core memory" videos of PS2 startup sounds, Need for Speed Underground gameplay clips).
- Play indie games, roguelikes, and anything with deep systems (Hades, Slay the Spire, Balatro, Vampire Survivors).
- On Twitch, YouTube (watch streamers like Northernlion, Ludwig, Moistcr1tikal), TikTok, Discord servers.
- Budget-conscious (will wishlist and wait for reviews or sales unless the hook is STRONG).
- Value "vibes" highly — aesthetics matter as much as mechanics.

**What they want:**
- A game that LOOKS incredible in clips. TikTok/Twitter clip potential is essential.
- Systems they can learn and master. They grew up on Soulsborne and roguelikes. Depth is expected.
- A story that doesn't talk down to them. They want themes, not tutorials.
- A game their favorite streamer will play.

**How we reach them:**
- TikTok clips (15-60 seconds): "POV: you just chained a drift into a dunk into a knockout," "The most 2003 game you've never played," "This game has a NEMESIS SYSTEM for street racing."
- Twitch/YouTube streamers who play indie games with depth (Northernlion, Baertaffy, DumbDog, Sinvicta for systems-heavy games; Ludwig, Atrioc, Moistcr1tikal for "this looks sick" energy).
- Discord communities: Indie game servers, racing game servers, fighting game servers. Post devlogs, post GIFs, answer questions.
- Steam Next Fest. This audience lives in Next Fest demos.

**The pitch to them:**
"It's a PS2 game that never existed, rendered with the AI and systems design of 2026. Also, it looks insane in motion."

---

### 2.3 Tertiary Audience: "The Systems Lovers" (25-45 years old, deep-game enthusiasts)

**Who they are:**
- Play Factorio, Balatro, Into the Breach, Slay the Spire, Football Manager, Crusader Kings.
- Care more about systems interaction than graphics or story.
- Will put 100+ hours into a game if the mechanical depth is there.
- Read dev blogs. Watch GDC talks. Lurk in design-focused forums.

**What they want:**
- To understand the systems. How does REP work? How does the rival AI adapt? What are the cross-discipline synergies?
- A game that rewards system mastery, not just execution skill.
- Transparency. They want dev blogs that explain the math, the tuning, the iteration process.

**How we reach them:**
- Dev blogs on Steam, Medium, or a dedicated site. Deep dives into the rival AI (Nemesis System comparison), the Style Meter as economy, the build synergies.
- GDC-style talks (if we get accepted to speak at events or can self-publish a "postmortem" style video).
- Reddit communities: r/gamedesign, r/truegaming, r/incremental_games (yes, really — they love deep progression systems).
- Hacker News (if we frame the AI rival system as a technical achievement).

**The pitch to them:**
"Four genres unified by one economy, one AI system, and emergent rivalries. The depth is the point."

## 3. MARKETING TIMELINE & BEATS

Marketing is not a phase. It's a practice that runs parallel to development from the first commit. Here's the roadmap.

### PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Months 1-3) — "Build the Socials, Plant the Seeds"

**Goal:** Establish presence. Start documenting development. Build a small, engaged core audience (500-1,000 followers/wishlists).

**Deliverables:**
- **Twitter/X account launch** (@UndergroundGame or similar). Post 3-5x/week: dev screenshots, GIFs of prototypes, "this week in development" updates, era-appropriate memes (2003 nostalgia content).
- **Steam page goes live (Coming Soon state).** Capsule art, short description, screenshots (even if early), tags. The wishlist button is live. Every piece of marketing from here on drives to this page.
- **Reddit presence.** Post in r/gamedev (dev logs), r/indiegaming (milestone posts), r/needforspeed and r/ps2 (nostalgia hooks). Do NOT spam. Provide value (behind-the-scenes, "here's how we're making the CRT shader work," etc.).
- **Discord server launch.** Small, invite-only initially. Grow it as wishlists grow. Channels: #announcements, #general, #dev-updates, #feedback. Invite early superfans and playtesters.

**Key Content:**
- "We're making the PS2 street culture game that never existed" (manifesto post, pinned on all socials).
- GIFs: Early drift prototype, early fight prototype, early ball prototype, Style Meter filling up.
- Dev blog #1: "Why UNDERGROUND? The games we loved, the game we're making."
- Meme energy: "POV: you just realized no one ever made NFS Underground but for ALL of street culture" with a reaction image.

**Success metrics:**
- 500-1,000 Steam wishlists.
- 1,000-2,000 Twitter/X followers.
- 100-200 Discord members.
- Reddit posts getting 50-100+ upvotes.

---

### PHASE 2: ANNOUNCEMENT (Month 4) — "The Viral Hook"

**Goal:** Announce the game to the world with a trailer that DOMINATES social media for 48-72 hours. Target: 10,000 wishlists in the first week post-announcement.

**Deliverables:**
- **Announcement Trailer (60-90 seconds).** This is THE moment. The trailer must:
  - Open with a black screen and the PS2 startup sound (or a close approximation — instant nostalgia hit).
  - Show the hook in the first 5 seconds: a player stepping out of a car with underglow, camera panning to a basketball court, same character, same night. "Four disciplines. One legend."
  - Hit every aesthetic beat: CRT scan lines, neon underglow, baggy jeans, chunky UI, the year "2003" stamped on screen.
  - Show all four disciplines in rapid cuts: drift through neon streets, knockout punch in a cage, ankle-breaker on the court, kickflip on a rooftop.
  - End with the Style Meter hitting max and UNDERGROUND MODE activating — screen glitches, colors invert, bass drops, title card: **UNDERGROUND. Coming 2027.**
  - Music: Original track or licensed (if budget allows, something Neptunes-adjacent or early Kanye energy).
  - No dialogue. Just gameplay, vibes, and the promise.

- **Press release.** Send to PC Gamer, IGN, Eurogamer, Kotaku, Polygon, Game Informer, RPS (Rock Paper Shotgun). Subject line: "UNDERGROUND: The NFS Underground / Def Jam / FIFA Street fusion game that never existed."

- **Reddit blitz.** Post the trailer in r/Games, r/gaming, r/pcgaming, r/PS2, r/needforspeed, r/indiegaming, r/GameTrailers. Time the posts for peak US hours (10am-12pm ET).

- **Twitter/X campaign.** Post the trailer. Tag influencers (gaming journalists, YouTubers, streamers). Use hashtags: #UNDERGROUND, #IndieGames, #PS2, #StreetRacing, #NeedForSpeed, #GameDev.

- **TikTok launch.** Cut the trailer into 15-30 second clips. Post multiple versions: "This game looks INSANE," "POV: it's 2003 and this is the only game you play," "They made NFS Underground but for EVERYTHING."

- **Press kit live.** Hosted on a simple landing page or presskit.it. Includes: high-res screenshots (10-15), logo (PNG, transparent), trailer (YouTube embed + downloadable), fact sheet, key art, contact info.

**Key Content:**
- The announcement trailer (YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, Steam, Discord).
- Press release with embargo lift at trailer drop.
- Dev blog #2: "How we're building UNDERGROUND: The art direction" (deep dive with PIXEL's process, reference images).
- Twitter thread: "The four disciplines, explained" (one tweet per discipline: racing, fighting, balling, tricks, with GIFs).

**Success metrics:**
- 10,000+ Steam wishlists in first week.
- Trailer hits 100,000+ views across platforms in 72 hours.
- 5+ press articles (even if small outlets).
- Reddit post in r/Games gets 500+ upvotes.

---

### PHASE 3: MOMENTUM (Months 5-9) — "The Devlog Drumbeat"

**Goal:** Keep the audience engaged between announcement and demo. Build to 30,000-50,000 wishlists by month 9. Establish the studio voice (HYPE, REED, NOVA as distinct personalities in devlogs).

**Deliverables:**
- **Monthly dev blogs.** Alternating focus:
  - Month 5: "The Rival AI: How we built the Nemesis System for street culture" (REED + BYTE collaboration piece).
  - Month 6: "Building the world: The six districts of UNDERGROUND" (NOVA, narrative-focused).
  - Month 7: "The Style Meter: How we unified four genres with one system" (REED, systems deep dive).
  - Month 8: "The soundtrack: Scoring 2003" (ECHO, even if game doesn't have sound design doc yet, this is thematic).
  - Month 9: "Art direction: Making a PS2 game in 2026" (PIXEL, visual breakdown).

- **Weekly social content.** 3-5 posts/week on Twitter/X, TikTok, Instagram (if budget allows):
  - GIF Tuesdays: Short gameplay GIFs (drifts, knockouts, ankle-breakers, trick combos).
  - Screenshot Thursdays: High-res stills with no UI, pure vibes (car under neon sign, character mid-dunk, fight ring at golden hour).
  - "Did you know?" Fridays: Small lore drops, system explanations, character teasers.

- **Influencer outreach begins.** Reach out to YouTubers and streamers who cover indie games, racing games, fighting games, retro games. Offer early builds (when ready), interviews, co-streams. Start with smaller creators (10k-100k subs) who are more responsive.

- **Community events:**
  - "Name a Rival" contest (Month 6): Community submits rival names, personalities, car/style choices. Winner's rival gets added to the game as a named NPC. Drives engagement, gets people invested.
  - "Best Build" showcase (Month 8): Post a hypothetical build challenge ("You have 5,000 CASH and 10,000 REP, what's your build?"). Community theorycrafts in Discord/Reddit. Shows system depth.

**Key Content:**
- 5 dev blogs (detailed, 1,500-2,500 words each, with images/GIFs).
- 40-60 social posts (GIFs, screenshots, mini-updates).
- 3-5 influencer features (interviews, "first look" videos).
- 1 community contest with real in-game reward.

**Success metrics:**
- 30,000-50,000 Steam wishlists by end of Month 9.
- 5,000-8,000 Twitter/X followers.
- 500-800 Discord members.
- Monthly dev blog posts get 2,000+ reads, shared in design communities.

- **Community demo feedback loop.** Pin a feedback form in Discord and on Steam forum. Ask specific questions: "Which discipline felt best?", "Did you understand the Style Meter?", "Was any event too hard or too easy?", "What did you want to customize that you couldn't?"

- Demo build (public, free, Steam Next Fest exclusive or time-limited).
- Demo trailer (30-45 seconds, Steam + socials).
- Dev blog #6: "The Demo is live: Here's what we learned building it" (post-Next Fest retrospective).

## 4. STORE PAGE COPY (Steam)

The Steam store page is THE conversion point. Everything drives here. This copy must SELL.

### 4.1 Short Description (Max 300 characters, shows on capsule hover)

"Race, fight, ball, and style your way from nobody to legend in the 2003 street culture game that never existed. Four disciplines, one city, one reputation system. Need for Speed Underground meets Def Jam meets FIFA Street meets Tony Hawk. Coming 2027."

(298 characters)

---

### 4.2 Long Description (Shows on main store page, formatted for readability)

**It's 2003. You're nobody. Build your name.**

UNDERGROUND is the street culture game the 2000s never finished. One city. Four disciplines. One reputation that follows you across racing, fighting, street sports, and freestyle tricks. No loading screens between who you are. No separate careers. One legend, four languages.

**FOUR DISCIPLINES, ONE IDENTITY**

- **RACING**: Drift through neon-soaked industrial corridors. Customize your car from engine to underglow. The Southside is yours if you can earn it.
- **FIGHTING**: Step into the cage at the Docks. Def Jam-style brawling with weight, impact, and grudges that last. Every rival remembers.
- **STREET SPORTS**: Ball at The Cage in Midtown. Ankle-breakers, alley-oops, and a crowd that reacts to every move. This is FIFA Street but it matters.
- **FREESTYLE TRICKS**: The Heights is a concrete skatepark. Grind, flip, link combos. Tony Hawk's Underground energy with modern trick chaining.

**THE STYLE METER: YOUR UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE**

How you win matters as much as whether you win. Drift with flair, taunt mid-fight, pull a crossover, land a trick — it all feeds the same Style Meter. Fill it, and UNDERGROUND MODE activates: time slows, your moves hit harder, the crowd loses it. Chain style across disciplines and become unstoppable.

**THE RIVAL SYSTEM: THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING**

Every named rival is an AI personality. Beat them and they adapt — or break. Show mercy and they might join your crew. Humiliate them and they'll ambush you in another district. This is the Nemesis System meets street culture. Your rivalries are unique, emergent, and personal.

**THE CITY REMEMBERS**

REP is everything. Earned through performance, weighted by style and difficulty, tracked across every event. Your playstyle shapes the world's reaction. The city isn't a backdrop — it's a character. Graffiti changes. NPCs reference your wins. Rivals gossip. The underground is alive.

**ONE CHOICE: UNDERGROUND OR MAINSTREAM**

A viral video exposed the scene. Now the cameras are watching. Promoters offer money, fame, legitimacy. Do you stay underground and keep it real? Go mainstream and cash in? Or try to walk the line? The game doesn't judge. It just remembers.

**LOOKS LIKE 2003. THINKS LIKE 2026.**

CRT scan lines. Underglow kits. Chunky beveled UI. Hip-hop on the soundtrack. Baggy jeans and Timbs. This is the PS2 aesthetic you remember, rendered with modern precision. Low-poly models, high-res textures, neon bleeding across wet asphalt. We're not making a retro game. We're finishing what the 2000s started.

**KEY FEATURES**

- Four full disciplines (racing, fighting, street sports, freestyle tricks) unified by one progression system
- AI-driven rival personalities with moods, grudges, respect, and emergent story arcs
- Cross-discipline style chaining: carry momentum from a drift into a dunk into a knockout
- Deep build system with synergies across disciplines (your car tuning affects your fighting style)
- Living open world: six districts, each with its own culture, boss, and dominant discipline
- Story about authenticity vs. fame, with branching paths based on your choices
- CRT-filter aesthetic, 2003 street culture fashion, hip-hop soundtrack
- 30-50 hour campaign, 80-100 hour mastery ceiling

**COMP IT LIKE THIS**

- "Need for Speed Underground meets Yakuza" — Racing in a living world where relationships matter

### 4.4 Capsule Art Description (For artist/PIXEL)

**Primary Capsule (616x353px, main store image):**

Wide shot of the city at night from a rooftop. Wet asphalt reflects neon signs (cyan, magenta, orange). Four silhouettes in the foreground (back to camera, looking out over the city):
1. Leaning on a car with cyan underglow.
2. Spinning a basketball on one finger.
3. Cracking knuckles, fight stance.
4. Mid-kickflip on a skateboard.

All the same person (identifiable by outfit silhouette). Different moments. Same legend.

CRT scan lines across the entire image (subtle, not overpowering). Slight chromatic aberration at edges.

Title logo: **UNDERGROUND** in chunky, chrome-beveled 2000s font (similar to NFS Underground's logo style). Centered, bottom third of image.

Tagline below logo (small, white text with drop shadow): "Four disciplines. One legend."

**Alternate Capsule (Header capsule, 460x215px, for store header):**

Close-up on a drifting car (Civic or 240SX-style import), underglow blazing cyan, tire smoke trailing, neon signs blurred in background. Player character visible through windshield (silhouette, not detailed). CRT scan lines. Logo bottom-right.

## 5. SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT PLAN

Social media is where the GIF lives. Every post must pass the "5-second scroll-stop" test.

### 5.1 Content Pillars (What we post about)

1. **GAMEPLAY GIFS** (40% of content) — Short, looping GIFs showing the best moments: perfect drifts, knockouts, ankle-breakers, trick combos, UNDERGROUND MODE activations. No UI, pure vibes. Posted to Twitter/X, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit.

2. **DEVLOG UPDATES** (20% of content) — Behind-the-scenes: "This week we finished the rival AI adaptation system," "Here's how we're making the CRT shader," "Meet the Southside district boss." Text + screenshot or short video. Builds transparency and trust.

3. **NOSTALGIA HOOKS** (20% of content) — "POV: you just got home from school in 2003 and this is loading," "If you know, you know" (image of a PS2 memory card), "The games that raised us" (collage of NFS Underground, Def Jam, FIFA Street, Tony Hawk covers). Engages the OG audience emotionally.

4. **COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT** (10% of content) — Retweets of fan art, responses to questions, poll posts ("Which discipline are you maining first?"), contest announcements. Makes followers feel heard.

5. **LORE & STORY DROPS** (10% of content) — Short character bios, district teasers, world-building snippets. "Meet Bishop, boss of the Docks. Undefeated. Unbreakable. But time comes for everyone." Builds narrative investment.

### 5.2 Platform-Specific Strategy

**TWITTER/X** (@UndergroundGame)
- Post frequency: 3-5x/week.
- Content: GIFs, screenshots, dev updates, replies to community, retweets of press/influencer coverage.
- Hashtags per post: 2-4 max (#UNDERGROUND, #IndieGames, #PS2, #StreetRacing, #GameDev).
- Tone: Energetic, punchy, emoji-light (no spam). HYPE's voice but not obnoxious.
- Pin: Steam wishlist link in bio and pinned tweet.

**TIKTOK** (@UndergroundGame)
- Post frequency: 2-3x/week.
- Content: 15-60 second gameplay clips with text overlay. "POV: you just chained a drift into a dunk," "This game has a NEMESIS SYSTEM for street racing," "The most 2003 game you've never played."
- Music: Use trending sounds when applicable, but prioritize original soundtrack (if we have stems, cut music-only clips for TikTok use).
- Hashtags: #Gaming, #IndieGame, #PS2, #NeedForSpeed, #Y2K, #Nostalgia, #StreetRacing, #FYP.
- Tone: Fast, punchy, meme-adjacent but not cringe.

**REDDIT**
- Post frequency: 1-2x/month (do NOT spam or Reddit will bury you).
- Content: Major updates only (announcement, demo drop, dev blog links, launch). Always include context in the post body, not just a link.
- Subreddits: r/Games (big announcements only), r/pcgaming, r/indiegaming (regular updates okay), r/gamedev (devlog-focused), r/needforspeed, r/ps2 (nostalgia hooks).
- Tone: Humble, transparent, "fellow gamer" energy. Reddit hates marketing speak.

**DISCORD**
- Post frequency: Daily (but not spammy — let community conversations flow).
- Content: Dev updates in #announcements, behind-the-scenes in #dev-updates, answer questions in #general, post polls in #feedback.
- Tone: Casual, HYPE's voice but collaborative. "What do you all think about this?" not "Here's what we decided."

**YOUTUBE** (Optional, lower priority)
- Post frequency: Monthly.
- Content: Dev vlogs (3-5 minutes, talking-head or voiceover with B-roll). Deep dives into systems, art process, music direction. Longer-form than TikTok.
- Tone: Informative, enthusiastic. HYPE narrating, or REED/NOVA/PIXEL guest-hosting their respective topics.

| Sunday | Twitter/X | Lore drop: "The Underground has one rule nobody wrote down: REP can't be bought. Or can it? Someone's been breaking the code. Find out who." | Narrative tease |

## 6. PRESS OUTREACH STRATEGY

Press coverage is credibility. One article in PC Gamer is worth 10,000 Twitter followers.

### 6.1 Press Target List (Tiered by Priority)

### 6.2 Outreach Email Template (Announcement Phase)

**Subject Line:**
"UNDERGROUND: The NFS Underground / Def Jam / FIFA Street fusion game that never existed"

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], marketing lead for UNDERGROUND, a new indie game that unifies street racing, street fighting, street sports, and freestyle tricks into one career — the 2003 street culture game the industry never made.

**The pitch:**
- Race like NFS Underground (drift physics, car customization, neon underglow).
- Fight like Def Jam: Fight for NY (brutal, weighty, rival-driven).
- Ball like FIFA Street (trick moves, style-as-scoring).
- Trick like Tony Hawk's Underground (combo chaining, city-as-skatepark).
- All in one open-world career with an AI rival system (Nemesis System-style) that tracks grudges, respect, and revenge across all four disciplines.

**The aesthetic:** PS2-era CRT scan lines, chunky UI, 2003 fashion, hip-hop soundtrack. We're making the game that should have existed but didn't.

**Why I'm reaching out:** We just dropped our announcement trailer [LINK] and I'd love to get your thoughts or coverage if it resonates. Press kit is here: [LINK]. Happy to answer questions, provide builds (when available), or set up an interview.

Target release: Q4 2027. PC (Steam) primary, console secondary.

Thanks for your time, and let me know if UNDERGROUND is something your audience would be into.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Contact Info]
[Twitter: @UndergroundGame]
[Steam: LINK]

---

**Why this works:**
- Subject line is punchy, high-concept, uses recognizable comps.
- First paragraph is one sentence that explains the entire game.
- Bullet list (press folks skim, not read).
- "Why I'm reaching out" is humble, not presumptive.
- Includes direct links (press kit, trailer, Steam) — make it EASY.
- Short (under 200 words). Respect their time.

---

## 7. COMMUNITY BUILDING STRATEGY

Community is the long-term value. Wishlists convert once. Community converts forever (DLC, sequels, word-of-mouth).

### 7.1 Discord Server Structure

**Channels:**

- **#announcements** (read-only, staff posts only) — Major updates, trailer drops, launch info.
- **#general** (open discussion) — Anything UNDERGROUND-related.
- **#off-topic** (memes, non-game chat) — Keeps #general focused.
- **#dev-updates** (read-only or low-moderation) — Behind-the-scenes, work-in-progress shots, HYPE's weekly check-ins.
- **#feedback** (structured feedback, moderated) — Bug reports, balance suggestions, feature requests.
- **#fan-art** (community creations) — Showcase art, screenshots, clips.
- **#builds-and-strategies** (theorycrafting) — Community discusses optimal builds, synergies, rival strategies. This is where the depth-loving audience thrives.
- **#looking-for-crew** (if multiplayer is added post-launch) — LFG equivalent.
- **Voice channels** (optional, low priority early).

**Moderation:**
- 2-3 volunteer mods (recruit from early active members).
- Rules: No spam, no hate speech, no piracy discussion, no spoilers without tags (post-launch).
- Tone: Chill, not draconian. We're building a community, not a police state.

**Engagement tactics:**
- Weekly "Screenshot of the Week" (staff picks one submission from #fan-art, winner gets a shoutout and maybe a small in-game reward like a custom decal if feasible).
- Monthly AMA with dev team (HYPE, REED, NOVA, PIXEL rotate as hosts).
- Early beta access for active Discord members (top contributors, longest-tenured members).

---

### 7.2 Reddit Strategy

**Subreddit:** r/UNDERGROUNDgame (create when community hits 500-1,000 active followers).

**Structure:**
- Moderation by dev team initially, transition to community mods post-launch.
- Flairs: Discussion, Bug Report, Fan Art, Meme, Dev Response, Suggestion.
- Weekly pinned threads: "What did you play this week?" (encourages check-ins post-launch), "Build of the Week" (community showcases).

**Engagement:**
- Dev team responds to top posts (not every post, but enough to show we're listening).
- Highlight community creations (fan art, montage videos) in #announcements on Discord and Twitter.

---

### 7.3 Influencer Relationships (Ongoing)

**Early Access Program:**
- 10-20 influencers get builds 1-2 weeks before public milestones (demo, beta, launch).
- No payment required (yet). Offer: "You get it early, we get organic coverage."
- Provide "streamer builds" (music toggle for DMCA safety, debug options for easier recording).

**Affiliate Program (Post-Launch):**
- If sales are strong (20k+ units), set up affiliate links. Influencers get a cut (5-10%) of sales from their link.
- This incentivizes ongoing coverage post-launch.

**Co-Streams:**
- Invite 3-5 streamers to co-stream with the dev team during beta or launch week. "Let's play together, answer your questions live."

---

## 8. TRAILER SCRIPT OUTLINE (Announcement Trailer)

- Text overlays are chunky, bold, 2000s font (white with drop shadow or neon glow).

## 9. BUDGET ALLOCATION (Estimated, Assumes $50k-$100k Marketing Budget)

If budget is tight, prioritize in this order: Steam page (free), socials (free), trailer production (essential), press outreach (free), influencer outreach (free initially), paid ads (optional).

| Line Item | Estimated Cost | Priority | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Trailer Production** (Announcement, Demo, Launch) | $10k-$20k | CRITICAL | If in-house, lower cost. If outsourced to a trailer house, $5k-$10k per trailer. Worth it. The trailer is the first impression. |
| **Press Kit / Website** | $1k-$3k | HIGH | Simple landing page (Wix, Squarespace, or custom). Press kit hosting. Domain name. |
| **Social Media Management Tools** | $500-$1k/year | MEDIUM | Hootsuite, Buffer, or similar for scheduling posts. Saves time. |
| **Paid Ads (Steam, Reddit, Twitter)** | $5k-$20k | MEDIUM | Steam's own ad system (if applicable), Reddit promoted posts, Twitter ads. Test small ($1k), scale if ROI is positive (clicks -> wishlists). |
| **Influencer Keys/Seeding** | $0-$5k | HIGH | Keys are free to give. If paying creators, budget $500-$2k for 3-5 sponsored videos (micro-influencers, 10k-50k subs). Bigger creators cost $5k-$20k (not worth it early). |
| **Community Events / Contests** | $500-$2k | MEDIUM | Prizes for community contests ("Name a Rival," "Best Build"). Could be Steam keys, merch, or in-game rewards. |
| **Music Licensing** (if applicable) | $5k-$15k | LOW (nice-to-have) | Licensing one or two recognizable tracks from 2000s hip-hop for trailer/game. Expensive and not essential (original music works fine). Only if budget allows. |
| **Convention Presence** (PAX, Gamescom, etc.) | $5k-$15k | LOW | Booth space, travel, swag. High visibility but expensive. Only if sales projections justify it. |
| **Merch** (T-shirts, stickers, etc.) | $1k-$3k | LOW | For giveaways, Kickstarter backer rewards (if applicable), or con swag. Not a revenue stream, just a community goodwill tool. |
| **Total** | **$23k-$82k** | — | Scale based on available budget. $50k is realistic for a well-funded indie. $20k is doable with DIY trailer and no paid ads. |

**If budget is under $20k:**
- Skip paid ads (organic reach only).
- DIY trailer (in-house editing, stock music or original score, no trailer house).
- No convention presence (digital-only marketing).
- Focus 100% on Steam page, socials, press outreach, influencer seeding.

**If budget is $50k+:**
- Invest in a pro trailer house ($10k-$15k for announcement + launch trailers).
- Allocate $10k to paid ads (Steam traffic campaigns, Reddit promoted posts).
- Budget $5k for influencer partnerships (3-5 mid-tier creators).
- Attend one major convention (PAX, Gamescom, etc.) if timing aligns with demo/launch.

## 10. SUCCESS METRICS & KPIs

How do we know the marketing is WORKING? Track these.

### 10.1 Wishlist Milestones (Steam)

| Milestone | Target Date | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1,000 wishlists | Month 3 (Foundation) | Early community forming. |
| 10,000 wishlists | Month 4 (Announcement week) | Viral moment worked. |
| 30,000 wishlists | Month 9 (Mid-Momentum) | Steady devlog drumbeat is working. |
| 70,000 wishlists | Month 10 (Post-Next Fest) | Demo converted interest to conviction. |
| 150,000 wishlists | Month 15 (Pre-launch) | We are in "algorithmic success" territory. Steam will promote us. |

**Why wishlists matter:**
- Conversion rate is typically 10-20% (10,000 wishlists = 1,000-2,000 Week 1 sales).
- 100k+ wishlists puts you on Steam's radar (featured spots, better search visibility).
- Wishlists drive urgency (Steam emails users on launch day).

---

### 10.2 Social Media Growth

| Platform | Followers (Month 3) | Followers (Month 9) | Followers (Launch) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Twitter/X | 1,000-2,000 | 5,000-8,000 | 15,000-25,000 |
| TikTok | 500-1,000 | 3,000-5,000 | 10,000-20,000 |
| Discord | 100-200 | 500-800 | 1,500-2,500 |
| Reddit (sub) | N/A (not created yet) | 200-500 | 1,000-2,000 |

**Why social matters:**
- Direct line to community (no algorithm gatekeeping on Discord).
- Viral potential (one TikTok can hit 500k+ views if it lands right).
- Word-of-mouth amplification (followers share your posts to their networks).

---

### 10.3 Press Coverage

| Metric | Target (Announcement) | Target (Demo) | Target (Launch) |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Articles (Tier 1 outlets) | 1-3 | 2-5 | 5-10 |
| Articles (Tier 2 outlets) | 3-8 | 5-12 | 10-20 |
| YouTuber videos (10k+ subs) | 2-5 | 5-10 | 20-30 |
| Aggregate views (press + YT) | 50k-100k | 200k-500k | 1M-3M |

**Why press matters:**
- Credibility (PC Gamer coverage = "real game, not shovelware").
- Reach (one article in IGN hits millions of readers).
- SEO (articles rank in Google for "games like NFS Underground").

---

### 10.4 Sales Targets (Post-Launch)

| Milestone | Units Sold | Revenue (at $45 price point) | Notes |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------|-------|
| Week 1 | 10,000-20,000 | $450k-$900k | Wishlist conversion (10-20% of 150k). |
| Month 1 | 25,000-40,000 | $1.1M-$1.8M | Word-of-mouth + reviews. |
| Month 6 | 50,000-80,000 | $2.25M-$3.6M | Long tail + sales. |
| Year 1 | 100,000-150,000 | $4.5M-$6.75M | Success threshold (after Steam cut, enough to fund DLC + sequel). |

**Break-even:** Depends on dev budget. If dev cost is $500k-$1M, break-even is 15k-25k units. If dev cost is $2M+, break-even is 50k+ units.

## 11. CLOSING NOTE: START NOW

Marketing is not a phase. Marketing is a practice.

The best time to start building the audience was six months ago. The second-best time is now.

Every day you wait is a day you're not building wishlists, not gathering feedback, not planting seeds in communities. The game that announces six months before launch and expects virality is the game that sells 200 copies.

UNDERGROUND has everything it needs to succeed:
- A hook that SCREAMS in five seconds ("Four games in one, 2003 aesthetic, Nemesis System for street culture").
- An audience that has been WAITING for this (25-38 year olds who never got NFS Underground 3, 18-25 year olds who just discovered Y2K culture).
- A visual identity that stops the scroll (CRT scan lines, neon, underglow, chunky UI).
- Systems deep enough to sustain 80-100 hour playthroughs (rival AI, cross-discipline synergies, build variety).

What it needs now is VISIBILITY. And visibility is built, not bought.

Post the GIF. Write the dev blog. Reach out to the YouTuber. Answer the Reddit comment. Host the Discord AMA. Drop the trailer. Push the wishlist button into every timeline, every feed, every forum where the audience lives.

The game is unfinished business. The marketing starts the moment you commit the first line of code.

Now go make some noise.

— HYPE
